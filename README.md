# NAME

Game::EvonyTKR - Perl Modules providing utilities for players of Evony The King's Return

# SYNOPSIS

    use Game::EvonyTKR;

    Game::EvonyTKR->execute();

# DESCRIPTION

This distribution aims to help players create and process the wealth of data that Evony The King's Return dumps on users with next to no organization, documentation, or built in tools to handle. 

This module will (eventually) help players of the game needing to make reasonably complex analysis to make optimal choices about each of these:

\* ["Which generals to invest time and resources in"](#which-generals-to-invest-time-and-resources-in)

\* ["How to best pair generals for different senarios"](#how-to-best-pair-generals-for-different-senarios)

\* ["The effects of Armor, Spiritual Beats, and Dragons on buffs and debuffs"](#the-effects-of-armor-spiritual-beats-and-dragons-on-buffs-and-debuffs)

\* ["Calculating your total buffs and debuffs in different senarios given the ever increasing number of sources for these buffs and debuffs"](#calculating-your-total-buffs-and-debuffs-in-different-senarios-given-the-ever-increasing-number-of-sources-for-these-buffs-and-debuffs)
