  - term: General
    definition: >-
      The game provides characters called 'Generals' that perform a number of roles.  The common theme to these roles is that the Generals provide
      you with 'Buffs' and 'Debuffs' which you can activate either by owning the General or by using the General. Generals provide these 'Buffs'
      and 'Debuffs' by way of 'Basic Attributes', 'SkillBooks', 'Ascending Attributes', 'Specialties', 'Covenants', any 'Gear' assigned to that
      General, and any 'Dragon' or 'Spiritual Beast' assigned.

      Each 'General' deployed in any capacity, either as part of a march, as a mayor, or as a duty officer, can be assigned items.  These items
      are most typically armor, but also include (in the same slots) things like hats and cloaks, and so can more properly be called by the generic
      words "gear" or "clothing."  I have chosen "gear."  In either case, the important thing is that each of these items has certain intrinsic
      'buffs' and 'debuffs', and can be 'refined' to contain others.  Depending on the use case, and on activation conditions (if any) on the
      'buffs' (or debuffs) provided, it may or may not be necessary for the 'General' to wear the gear full time, it may be possible to have the
      gear on the 'General' only while assigning the 'General.'
