## Introduction

Monster hunting is one of the most important activities in Evony. You will get
more resources, chests, and pretty much everything you need from items in less
time than any other activity. It is not that other activities are not
important, even crucial, but simply that they are slower in producing high
volumes of items.

When it comes to monster hunting, you can hunt normal monsters or boss
monsters. These differ in that boss monsters can be rallied, and normal
monsters cannot. They also differ in the amount and quality of the rewards,
though there is some gray area here, because a high end normal monster might be
better than a low end boss.

As implied above, when looking at boss monsters, you might be participating in
an "Alliance War" or "rally" with others from your alliance, or you might be
hunting on your own. The mechanics differ very slightly, the rewards do not.
