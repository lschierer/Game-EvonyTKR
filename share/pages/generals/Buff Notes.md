Much of this data is based on the videos from [Derrick Defies], who claims to have figured out more about Evony's internal mechanics, with greater proof, than anyone other source I have seen.

### Skill Books

- The Ground and Mounted speed skill books do not actually do anything based on testing
  - A simple test is attack a keep with a single ground unit in it.
  - attack with a single t5 siege (350 range)
  - attack with l2 range increase
  - attack with ground speed
- The Ranged Troop Range Bonus skill books have misleading/false numbers
  - Each book gives you a bonus of 17 units over the prior.
  - The L1 book gives you a range bonus of 17 units
  - The L2 book gives you range bonus of 34 units
  - The L3 book gives you a range bonus of 51 units
  - The L4 book gives you a range bonus of 68 units
- The Siege Machine Range Bonus books are off by a factor of 10.
  - The L4 book gives you a range bonus of 20
