<aside class="note">
In the [Overview], I explain my thinking. This is a fairly long article, but
contains a lot of useful background information if you want to understand how
I arrived at these conclusions. If you just want to be told what to do, you
can skip it and dive right in here.

## For Free to Play Players:

Unless your alliance consists only of free players, I strongly recommend you
consider just joining rallies, and waiting until later to develop a [PvM] pair.
If you do want to hunt monters, you will need to double up on your [PvM] and
[PvP] pairs, despite the fact that this is suboptimal.  Give this pair the
following Skill Books:

- Mounted Attack
- March Size
- Mounted Defense
- Mounted HP
- Mounted Monster Attack
- Mounted Mounted Monster HP

If you are just going to join rallies, replace the two Monster books with
* March Speed
* either Mounted March Speed or Siege Range Bonus

## For Light Spenders

Again, I recommend skipping the [PvM] pair until latter.  If your alliance,
or your own desires, needs you to be hunting monsters before other pairs
are developed, then I recommend that you develop a single very strong [primary general]
and one [assistant] for [PvM] use and one for [PvP] use.

Give the [primary general]
- Mounted Attack
- March Size
- Mounted HP

Give the [PvP] [assistant]
- Mounted Defense
- March Speed
- either Mounted March Speed or Siege Range Bonus

Give the [PvM] [assistant]
- Mounted Monster Attack
- Mounted Mounted Monster HP
- Mounted Monster Defense

Spend enough to get Theodora, she is compatible with many, though not all,
of the generals that you will have available to you as [primary generals].
Set her up as your [PvM] assistant, and together they make a great pair for
maximizing your returns on the monsters you hunt. You won't be able to take
on the absolute biggest monsters quite as fast, but it is still a respectable pair.

Later, when you are able to replace her with a better [PvM] assistant, use her to join rallies, giving her
- March Speed
- March Speed against Monsters
- Luck

## For Medium Spenders

Set up several copies of Theodora with
- March Speed
- March Speed against Monsters
- Luck

and use the Rally Card to join as many rallies as possible using this general.  Optionally pair her with Spartacus
to reduce your Stamina usage ([Ascend] Spartacus, which is free, and only requires fragments).
