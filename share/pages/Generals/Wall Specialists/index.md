<aside class="note">
In the [Overview], I explain my thinking. This is a fairly long article, but
contains a lot of useful background information if you want to understand how
I arrived at these conclusions. If you just want to be told what to do, you
can skip it and dive right in here.

</aside>

When you first start out, you ought to be [ghosting] your troops whenever you
might be attacked. As a result, your Wall generals are not going to help you
any because they will not have any troops to lead. Focus on your [ranged] and
[mounted] generals first.

While you are busy developing these other generals, keep your eye out for
Shajar al-Durr. If you find her in the tavern (or win her in an event), she
makes an excellent _**peace time**_ wall general. She will help you get the
resources you need to do other things.

Eventually however you are ready to grow beyond [ghosting] and to do that,
you need to have a good set of wall generals. Moreover, you need to have them
fairly well-developed already, not brand new. You thus must start developing your Wall pair _long_ before you will start to use them, except _maybe_ in Battlefield.

George Dewey is available in the General's Chest in the Tavern. He is
unquestionably the best main wall defense general available for those who do
not spend heavily. Collect every fragment and copy of him that you can. You
need a total of 16 copies of him - one to use, the others in the form of
fragments.[^230107-2]

Looking at your troops in your Rally Spot, mentally subtract out your main PvP
march. You want to think about what is left when that is out attacking someone.

- If the remainder is mostly mounted troops, pick Queen Boudica for your
  assistant wall general.
- If the remainder is mostly ground troops, pick Robert the Bruce as your
  assistant wall general.
- If the remainder is mostly ranged or siege class troops, look at what is the
  next most numerous type.
  - If the next most numerous type is ground, pick between Robert the Bruce and
    Tran Hung Dao. The former makes your ground troops stronger, the latter
    focuses on your siege while helping your ground troops.
  - If the next most numerous type is mounted, pick Queen Boudica.

If none of these describe you, then consider Ly Thuong Kiet, but you really
ought to question if you are ready to engage in PvP yet.

#### Event Participants

If you see any of the following, they are superior choices for assistants available only as part of paid events:

- Leo III - specializes in siege troops. Use him if you plan on building a
  _**lot**_ of siege type troops.
- Lautaro - specializes in ground troops with a secondary effect on mounted
  troops. You can use him in place of either Queen Boudica or Robert the Bruce.
- Yodo-dono - specializes in ranged troops with a secondary generic boost to HP.
