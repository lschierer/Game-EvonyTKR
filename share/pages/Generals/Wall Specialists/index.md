When you first start out, you ought to be [ghosting] your troops whenever you
might be attacked. As a result, your Wall generals are not going to help you
any because they will not have any troops to lead. Focus on your [ranged] and
[mounted] generals first.

While you are busy developing these other generals, keep your eye out for
Shajar al-Durr. If you find her in the tavern (or win her in an event), she
makes an excellent _**peace time**_ wall general. She will help you get the
resources you need to do other things.  **_NEVER_** use Shajar as a [primary]
general, even during peace time.  Only ever use her as an [assistant].


Eventually however you are ready to grow beyond [ghosting] and to do that,
you need to have a good set of wall generals. Moreover, you need to have them
fairly well-developed already, not brand new. You thus must start developing
your Wall pair _long_ before you will start to use them, except _maybe_ in Battlefield.

George Dewey is available in the General's Chest in the Tavern. He is
unquestionably the best main wall defense general available for those who do
not spend heavily. Collect every fragment and copy of him that you can. You
need a total of 16 copies of him - one to use, the others in the form of
fragments.[^230107-2]

Looking at your troops in your Rally Spot, mentally subtract out your main PvP
march. You want to think about what is left when that is out attacking someone.
