In the [Overview][], I explain my thinking. This is a fairly long article, but
contains a lot of useful background information if you want to understand how I
arrived at these conclusions. If you just want to be told what to do, you can
skip it and dive right in here.

Interestingly, this advice applies almost equally well to both free players and
light spenders.

While you can get lucky, you are best off waiting until your tavern is at level
27, or even better, at level 30, before you invest significant gems refreshing
its options looking for generals. With each level up, the odds of getting a
good general in the tavern goes up in small, but noticeable increments. By keep
27 the consensus seems to be that you start to have a reasonable chance of
getting the general(s) you want within a couple _thousand_ refreshes.

Yes, that is right, I said a couple _thousand_. And yes, these do need to all
be done at the same time, because something about the lottery engine behind the
tavern detects multiple sequential refreshes and slowly improves your odds with
each click of the refresh button. And yes, this is takes a _lot_ of gems.
That is why you start saving early, and _do not waste gems trying_ before your
tavern is at the appropriate level.

When you go into the tavern to start refreshing like crazy, you are looking for
several different things.

1. [Mayors][] for your sub cities.
1. Extra copies of generals you picked in other sections of this guide.
1. Copies of Queen Jindock. You want _five_ copies to use, and maybe a few
   spare for fragments that you will someday use. You will use her for
   gathering [RSS][] from tiles.
1. Copies of Theodora You want at least _four_ copies, and no more than your number
   of marches. Do not bother ascending this general.
1. Copies of Baibars. Take the number of marches you have, and subtract
   from this the number of copies of Theodora you have. The result is
   the number of Baibars you should have.
1. If you see Amir Timur, having _one_ copy of him to send to relics can be
   useful. Load is the _only_ statistic that matters for relics. The higher
   your load, the more you bring home. Nothing else matters. You can
   influence the speed of relic exploration with research, but nothing your
   general is or does will matter. Amir also makes a useful assistant if you
   find an empty keep that for some reason has a ton of available [RSS][].
1. Some [Duty][] generals are also available in the tavern.
1. Certain generals necessary for the [General's Hall][] are available in the
   tavern. If these generals come up, get them. _**However**_, if they are
   not listed somewhere in these recommendation pages, you are going to keep
   them just long enough to restart the game, and then sell them. Restarting
   the game seems to ensure that the credit for having the general persists.
   Otherwise, occasionally the game will forget that you had the general. Yes
   this is a bug, and restarting should not be necessary. Yes buying and
   selling a general seems like a waste of gold, however the things that
   activating your general's hall unlocks is worth the cost.
