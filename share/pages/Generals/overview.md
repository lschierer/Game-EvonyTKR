### General Principles

Knowing what generals to keep and what generals to get rid of is an important
topic as you start building your keep. It is a complicated question. Most of
us will never have as many skill books, rune stones, general fragments, or
blood of ares as we would like. Hard decisions need to be made, and the
consequences of a poor decision can be intimidating.

If you look my sources[^230107-1], you will see that there is a 80 to 90 percent overlap in
the information they provide in generals, but there is some disagreement
between them. Use whichever guide you feel you understand best.

[^230107-1]: See the list of pages on the [Home page]

[Home page]: /

When picking your generals, you need to consider several things.

1. Since covenants have come out, the generals that have them massively
   outperform those who do not.  You will be at a severe disadvantage
   if your primary general does not have a covenant, and/or if you
   cannot activate it.
1. If you play long enough, you will get premium generals. You may not,
   however, be able to *ever* fully [ascend] these premium generals, or fully
   activate their covenants.  This matters a great deal when picking your main
   general, but assistants are *comparatively* easy to replace, *until* you
   are ready to invest rune stones in an assistant general.
1. If you save up your premium general tokens before using them until you
   have at least 75 and preferably close to 100, you *should* be able to [ascend] the newest general(s) available to at least four stars, and if you are very lucky, five stars.  However, getting that many tokens will be a once or twice a year occurance for free players and light spenders.  Pick whom you use these tokens on *very* carefully.
1. Following up on the above, a general that you can get fragments for may be
   *theoretically* weaker than some other general, but if you cannot get
   fragments for the other general, the one you can is *in practice* stronger.
1. Most dragons are *really* only available to paying players. If you play
   long enough you will *probably*, **eventually** get your wings, and after
   that, your second level wonder. For a Free to Play player, this may be over a year. However, that means 4 dragons. You are unlikely to ever have any others. If a general requires a dragon, do you have one for him/her? Will you ever? If so, when? Who will you use in the mean time?
1. Rune Stones are incredibly scarce. You don't actually need most of your
   generals to be fully maxed out however. You can get noticeable benefit from a general with 3 purple specialties if you pick the right generals. Pick one general to max out, either your main monster general or your main PVP general. Forget going beyond purple for the rest until that one is done. If some other general needs rune stones to be useful, consider an
   alternative.

While I have seen generic generals that by random chance have attractive
attributes (such as ore exploitation as a specialty), these are the exception. Also note, that the advice below represents lessons learned, things I wish I had understood months ago.

In general, unless you have more slots for generals than you know what to do
with, stick to Historic Gold Generals. The attributes on these will be better, the skills more diverse and stronger, the specialties better.

Not all Gold Historic Generals are worth getting. Some of them, compared to
others, almost look like Purple Historic Generals. You still need to be
discerning.

For many of them, the value depends on your style of game play and your
strategy of warfare. You cannot be strong everywhere, so why bother having the theoretical best pair for all four troop types? Odds are you can only actually max out one of these anyway. What your really need are generals that are good enough while you work on your priorities.

### What Generals You Need

As you look at the ordered list below, realize that you may not have the
general that you want to work on today. In other words, **_plan_** rather than accept compromises based on the generals you randomly happen to get first.

1. Decide if you care about running rallies yourself, or if you are content
   to only join them. If you do, you need a good monster general pair. This is different than a mounted PVP pair (the generals you pick for each role are different). If you care about running rallies, this general and h./her assistant needs to be your priority. ([2 generals](../mounted))

2. Decide on make-up of your main PVP march. This will determine your main
   PVP general and main PVP assistant. If you run rallies, this will be the *second* general you look at. If you do not, this will be the *first*. (2 generals)

3. Decide *one* troop type that you will (eventually) have a TON of.[^Note]
   This need not be the same as your main PVP march (particularly if you run rallies). You will *someday* use this as the bulk of your meat shield and the bulk of your keep's defenses. Look for Wall Defense generals that complement this troop type. You need a main general and an assistant general. The main general will be the *third* general you max out. ([2 generals](./wall))

4. Look for generals that are specialized as duty generals for your keep and
   other buildings. If you find one for a building that is too small to get a
   mayor, either use this general as a mayor for some other building or break
   him into fragments for later. (the number of generals needed grows with
   your keep size, assume a minimum of 8)

5. Look for generals that are specialized as "debuff" generals. These will be
   your sub city mayors. You have to be careful with these. If you do not
   plan on investing rune stones on these, they rate _very_ differently than if you do plan on investing rune stones on them.[^scn] ([between 4 and 8 generals needed, depending on how many sub cities you have](./mayors))

6. Look for Baibars and Queen Jindock. You will someday want five
   Theodo./Baibars and five Queen Jindock generals. Take your time finding these, but if you see one and you have slots available, do not pass them up. Use Theodora and Baibars to join rallies; use Jindock to gather. ([10 generals](../misc))


### Picking a Primary General

Now that we know more or less what we are watching for, how to pick those primary generals?

* If you look at the details on your general tokens, they each have lists
  of probabilities.  Different tokens will have different probability lists,
  and these will change over time if you hang on to the token.  Only pay
  attention to generals for whom you have *many* tokens where you have *at
  least* at 10% chance of getting that general.[^many]
* Look for a general that has generous march size increase [buffs].  He or
  she should have a march size [buff] of *at least* 18% when you add up the main skill book, the specialties, ascending [buffs], and covenant.
* Look for a general that has relatively few adjectives or adverbs on his or
  her [buffs].  Adjectives and adverbs like "Attacking," "Marching," "when
  rallying," "to attack," or "brings a dragon" will limit when you get to
  benefit from these [buffs].
* Ideally wait a few days, ask other players who spend more how this general
  pairs with generals you already have.  You do not want a general that is hard to find assistants for.
* If you get lucky this site can add the general to the comparison tables
  quickly.  You can use the "Attacking" tables for your main [PvP] general
  pairs, and the [PvM] tables for your monster hunting pairs. *Be aware that information about which generals conflict with which is almost never
  available for new generals, so the table will include some pairs that are not in fact usable.*
* Fully activating a covenant requires that you get both the general you plan
  to use and at least two of the other three generals listed in the covenant
  fully cultivated, and up to at least level 30, and possibly as high as level 40.  For some generals, the mechanics of the particular generals'
  basic attributes means that you need all four generals, and/or to level
  them up even higher.  *DO NOT* pick a general if he or she requires, for
  the covenant activation, other generals that are incredibly rare and
  expensive.  It will certainly require premium generals, but some are
  *much* harder to get than others.

### Picking an Assistant General

A free player will in general pick the best assistant he or she has by
chance from the list of generals compatible with the primary general
chosen.  The harsh limitations of playing for free are brutal.

A light spender should disable covenants and specialty four for the
assistant in the relevant general pairs table to help him/her pick
appropriate assistants.  Set the specialties for the assistant to either
three purple or, at most, three orange.

A medium spender should set the specialties to three orange, and can consider setting them to three gold and the fourth to purple or orange, but should *not* set them to four gold.  The covenant should be active on both
the primary and secondary general, but probably not maxed out on the assistant; set it to either 'Faith' or maybe "Honor' level.

Remember, that ascending an assistant *can* help activate a covenant *some* but
1) is not an efficient way of doing so
2) does not help you in any other way.


[^Note]: **_DO NOT_** start building a ton of this troop type *yet*.  You need to be able to [ghost].  Your total number of troops should be less than or equal to the size of your march (with march increase [buffs]) times the number of marches you have available to you.

[^many]: "Many" tokens is defined as:
    * _**NO MATTER WHAT, NO LESS THAN 50**_ tokens.
    * ideally no less than 75 tokens.
    * best case about 100 tokens.


[^scn]: Recommended Investment Levels:
    * For Free Players, I recommend investing *no more than* Blue level
      specialties.
    * For Light Spenders, I *strongly* recommend investing to Purple level.
    * For Medium Spenders, I recommend *at least* Purple level, and
      considering Orange Level.
