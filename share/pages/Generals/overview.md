Knowing what generals to keep and what generals to get rid of is an important
topic as you start building your keep. It is a complicated question. Most of
us will never have as many skill books, rune stones, general fragments, or
blood of ares as we would like. Hard decisions need to be made, and the
consequences of a poor decision can be intimidating.

If you look my sources[^230107-1], you will see that there is a 80 to 90 percent overlap in
the information they provide in generals, but there is some disagreement
between them. Use whichever guide you feel you understand best.

When picking your generals, you need to consider several things.

1. If you play long enough, you will get premium generals. You may not,
   however, be able to _ever_ fully [ascend][] these premium generals. This
   matters a great deal when picking your main general, but assistants are
   _comparatively_ easy to replace, _until_ you are ready to invest rune stones
   in an assistant general.
1. Following up on the above, a general that you can get fragments for may be
   _theoretically_ weaker than some other general, but if you cannot get
   fragments for the other general, the one you can is _in practice_ stronger.
1. Most dragons are _really_ only available to paying players. If you play
   long enough you will _probably_, _eventually_ get your wings, and after
   that, your second level wonder. For a Free to Play player, this may be over
   a year. However, that means 4 dragons. You are unlikely to ever have any
   others. If a general requires a dragon, do you have one for him/her? Will
   you ever? If so, when? Who will you use in the mean time?
1. Rune Stones are incredibly scarce. You don't actually need most of your
   generals to be fully maxed out however. You can get noticeable benefit from
   a general with 3 purple specialties if you pick the right generals. Pick
   one general to max out, either your main monster general or your main PVP
   general. Forget going beyond purple for the rest until that one is done.
   If some other general needs rune stones to be useful, consider an
   alternative.

While I have seen generic generals that by random chance have attractive
attributes (such as ore exploitation as a specialty), these are the exception.
Also note, that the advice below represents lessons learned, things I wish I
had understood months ago.

In general, unless you have more slots for generals than you know what to do
with, stick to Historic Gold Generals. The attributes on these will be better,
the skills more diverse and stronger, the specialties better.

Not all Gold Historic Generals are worth getting. Some of them, compared to
others, almost look like Purple Historic Generals. You still need to be
discerning.

For many of them, the value depends on your style of game play and your
strategy of warfare. You cannot be strong everywhere, so why bother having the
theoretical best pair for all four troop types? Odds are you can only actually
max out one of these anyway. What your really need are generals that are good
enough while you work on your priorities.

As you look at the ordered list below, realize that you may not have the
general that you want to work on today. In other words, _plan_ rather than
accept compromises based on the generals you randomly happen to get first.

1. Decide if you care about running rallies yourself, or if you are content to
   only join them. If you do, you need a good monster general pair. This is
   different than a mounted PVP pair (the generals you pick for each role are
   different). If you care about running rallies, this general and his/her
   assistant needs to be your priority. ([2 generals](../mounted/))

2. Decide on make-up of your main PVP march. This will determine your main PVP
   general and main PVP assistant. If you run rallies, this will be the _second_
   general you look at. If you do not, this will be the _first_. (2 generals)

3. Decide _one_ troop type that you will have a TON of. This need not be the
   same as your main PVP march (particularly if you run rallies). You will
   _someday_ use this as the bulk of your meat shield and the bulk of your keep's
   defenses. Look for Wall Defense generals that complement this troop type.
   You need a main general and an assistant general. The main general will be
   the _third_ general you max out. ([2 generals](../wall/))

4. Look for generals that are specialized as duty generals for your keep and
   other buildings. If you find one for a building that is too small to get a
   mayor, either use this general as a mayor for some other building or break
   him into fragments for later. (the number of generals needed grows with
   your keep size, assume a minimum of 8)

5. Look for generals that are specialized as "debuff" generals. These will be
   your sub city mayors. You have to be careful with these. If you do not
   plan on investing rune stones on these, they rate _very_ differently than if
   you do plan on investing rune stones on them. ([between 4 and 8 generals
   needed, depending on how many sub cities you have](../mayors/))

6. Look for Baibars and Queen Jindock. You will someday want five
   Theodora/Baibars and five Queen Jindock generals. Take your time finding these,
   but if you see one and you have slots available, do not pass them up. Use
   Theodora and Baibars to join rallies; use Jindock to gather. ([10 generals](../misc/))
