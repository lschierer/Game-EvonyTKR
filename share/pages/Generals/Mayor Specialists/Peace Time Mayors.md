## Peace Time Mayors as a Concept

Periodically someone asks about Catherine II, or another of the peace time
subcity mayors. To answer this question, we need to compare the two following
generals.

Both mayors have been put on the same subcity in turn. Mayor number 1,
Catherine, results in an average training speed of +329.79% while mayor number
2, Harald, results in an average speed of +441.2%. Thus, despite Catherine's
special skill, Domination, giving her a training speed boost of 35% to Harald's
25% Level 4 Training Speed skill book, he is able to train troops faster.

If I were willing to  to cultivate Catherine to an equal extent, I have no doubt that she would outperform Harald. The question is, given how many gems are involved in cultivating mayors up to that level, can you afford to do so to two sets of them?

This is one of those places in Evony where you need to make a decision on your
spending levels. If you want to have peace time subcity mayors, be prepared to
invest significant amounts of gems, rune stones, and medals in them. If you
are not willing to do so, your more fully developed war time generals will
probably provide better training, construction, and gold bonuses than a poorly
developed set of peace time generals.

## Important Note about Ascending

The astute reader may have noticed that in the preceding concept section I mentioned cultivating Catherine to an equal extent as Harald, but did not mention [ascending] her to the same two star level.  This omission was deliberate, and is important.  It is not merely that in this *particular* example neither mayor was [ascended] to any extent, rather Catherine is one of several mayors who is not *entirely* a peace time mayor.  While her main skill book, and her specialty [buffs] are those of a peace time mayor, her [ascending] [buffs] are a totally different story.  If you can ascend her, she becomes one of the more valuable Siege HP debuff generals.

This is then a slight, but incredibly significant, caveat to my overall opinion of peace time mayors.  I maintain that the concept of a peace time mayor is a waste of resources for nearly everyone.  However, be careful that you have fully evaluated each mayor, and that you are not ignoring [buffs] that might truly help you before dismissing a given general *as* a peace time mayor.

To be clear: I am __*NOT*__ recommending using Catherine II as a peace time mayor.  I am recommending that, if you can ascend her, she be used as a *[PvP]* mayor. There are a other generals that, like her, appear on the surface to be peace time mayors, but have hidden PvP potential.  The reader will need to evaluate these mayors as and against other PvP mayors on the strength of these [PvP] [buffs].
