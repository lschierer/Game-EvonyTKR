<aside class="note">
In the [Overview], I explain my thinking. This is a fairly long article, but
contains a lot of useful background information if you want to understand how
I arrived at these conclusions. If you just want to be told what to do, you
can skip it and dive right in here.

### Philosophy

As you look at the many generals in Evony for mayors, you are looking for what
are called "[debuff]" generals. These are generals that reduce one or more
attributes of the attacking general and/or attacking army. While you can
"debuff" the enemy's ability to attack, the enemy's health (HP), or the enemy's
ability to defend against your counter-attack (defense), these last two amount
to the same thing in practice. Both of them reduce the enemy's ability to
survive your counter-attack, while the first one reduces his/her ability to
attack you.

So which strategy do you prefer? The best defense is a strong offense? You
will want to go all out building ranged and particularly sieged troops. Or do
you depend on your own PvP march to do the real damage and you just want to
survive while that happens? If so focus on ground and mounted troops.

There are strong arguments each way, and both positions are presented better
in other places. Alternately, take a hybrid approach and look for the few
names that appear on both lists. These may not be the strongest mayors in one
or both categories, but that they show in the list at all means they are still
among the top choices available.

At this time, I do not recommend the use of peace time mayors for either free
or light spenders. I explain why [here][peace].

In the [Mayor Comparison Table], see how radically the lists change as you look at different levels of investment in your mayors. I recommend Free Players set the investment level selectors to a low Covenant level, 2 or 3 Red Ascending Stars, and 3 Purple Specialties for the first 3 Specialties. Unless you know yourself to be able to invest highly, you should otherwise set the Specialty levels no higher than 3 Orange and 3 or 4 Red Stars.



### Reducing the Enemy's Ability to Attack You

This is for people who depend on their PvP march and are just trying to survive
the enemy's attack in the mean time. While you would not mind hurting the
enemy, you are focused on preventing him/her from hurting you.

### Reducing the Enemy's Ability to Survive Your Attack

This is for people who want to make the enemy regret the decision to attack
their keep. They plan on having enough sieged troops to totally destroy any
incoming march. To make this possible, they want to make each attack by their
own siege count for as much as possible.

### Trying to find balance

Some authors advocate an approach where you look at the overall amount that
each general reduces the enemy's stats, regardless of what specific attribute
is being debuffed. There are trade offs with this hybrid approach,
as while it is great that you are both reducing attack and reducing toughness,
the resulting generals are not the strongest in either category. My instinct
is that a free or light spender is probably better off specializing with
generals from either the attack debuff set or the toughness debuff set,
rather than attempting to do both with one of these lists.
