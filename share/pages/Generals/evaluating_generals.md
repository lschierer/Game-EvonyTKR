title: Evaluating Generals

I've been watching John Wick's videos and while a general with a specialized buff will theoretically be stronger, they
are _more specialized_ and will be weaker for corresponding use cases. I'm thus increasingly inclined to _penalize_ a general for having an
adverb on his/her buff unless being evaluated for a specialty role.

- I am unsure how much to count death into wounded. It definitely helps your survivability, but both in battlefield and
  SvS "death" is modified drastically anyway. I have heard rumors that this is a misleading name for the actual buff, and that it, and the "Mortality" Monarch Talent actually affect your HP directly. I cannot find any solid documentation on this.

  For now I am not using that buff. If you are on a BoB server where actual troop death is a serious concern,
  then you probably ought to just bubble up and not worry about your generals anyway, or cut your losses and find a new
  server.

- I am unsure how to count wounded to death. This follows from death into wounded. How much does it actually hurt the other person in either SvS or Battlefield? Does it affect Monster hunting _at all_? It is currently
  ignored as well.
- There is at least one general with a "during SvS" buff. I am inclined to discount this as well. This site is targeted
  at people who need to be able to use their generals
  in all PvP use cases. Having separate PvP and PvM
  generals will be difficult enough.
- Rally capacity is an interesting buff for members of well organized alliances. It can help with World Boss, very large monsters you are (as an alliance) willing to accept wounded on, and of course both SvS and
  Battlefield. However, while it might be nice to know, I do not think it can or should truly do more than tip the balance between two otherwise very close pairs. I am not currently displaying it, though I may
  do so in the future. I certainly _won't_ use it to compute scores as I look at that aspect of ranking pairs.
- I am counting an attack debuff towards a general's defense buffs on the understanding that if the opposing general can attack less, my defense is that much stronger.
- I am counting _either_ an HP or Defense debuff towards a general's _attack_ debuff. The working theory is that either an HP or Defense debuff makes my attack more effective, thus effectively stronger.
- I am counting neither of the above two debuff line items when considering Monsters unless the debuff is labeled "against monsters". I do not think standard debuffs apply to monsters.
