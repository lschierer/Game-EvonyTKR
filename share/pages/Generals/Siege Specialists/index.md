<aside class="note">
In the [Overview], I explain my thinking. This is a fairly long article, but
contains a lot of useful background information if you want to understand how
I arrived at these conclusions. If you just want to be told what to do, you
can skip it and dive right in here.

</aside>

Your Siege generals will be the _last_ PvP generals you invest [rune stones]
and [BoA] on. This is because siege troops require gems to heal.

### For Free to Play Players:

There are only two traditionally recommended generals that are also easily
[ascended] by a F2P player for siege troops:

- Matthias I
- Ulysses S. Grant [D]

That 'D' signifies that Grant requires a dragon to be of any use, and neither
of these are great options to begin with. That being said, Napoleon is fairly
easy to win, so even a free player might get enough copies of him to give him
at least one or two red stars. I am unsure how a Napoleon with one red star
compares to a Matthias with three or more red stars.

However, my analysis indicates that **[Suleiman the Magnificent]** is consistently undervalued and underrated. Ascended to three red stars, pairs with him as primary have similar attack buffs as the current leading premium generals once you realize that his [debuffs] will make the attack he does have more effective.

He is thus my recommendation. You should then pick one of the many premium generals that [Suleiman] pairs with as your assistant.

### For Light Spenders

For light spenders, it is increasingly the case that the best choices for
primary generals are premium generals. Additionally, because the siege general
_is_ the last general you should be working on anyway, you have more time to
slowly, over the course of (literally) years, assemble the fragments you
need to [ascend] this general.

Eventually you will have your [ranged], [ground], [wall], and not just
one [mounted] but both a [PvP] and [Monster] mounted pair all maxed out on
[rune stones], and all either [ascended] or waiting on more fragments to
finish ascending. _Then and only then_ will you evaluate which siege generals you have the most fragments of and from that which one to start developing. In fact, you might even wait until you have _Suleiman's_ specialties maxed out to four gold as well before deciding (although remember not to ascend your assistant).

Lastly, keep in mind that siege is often the best troop class to use for
reinforcing someone's keep. However, due to the way that [buff] activation
conditions work, many of these premium generals face significant disadvantages
when used this way. [Raimondo], [Teach], and [Suleiman] will retain their value, and [Septimius Severus], who when evaluated as an attack general falls just below top tier, starts to look much more attractive.

If you are a light spender, I strongly recommend accepting the smaller attack [buff] in favor of being able to get points using this pair to reinforce others in your alliance.
