<aside class="note">
In the [Overview], I explain my thinking. This is a fairly long article, but
contains a lot of useful background information if you want to understand how
I arrived at these conclusions. If you just want to be told what to do, you
can skip it and dive right in here.

### For Free to Play Players :

You should be using archers as your main PVP force.

Give your primary general the following skill books:

- Ranged Attack Increase
- Ranged Troop Range Increase
- Ranged Troop HP _OR_ Ranged Troop Defense


Give the assistant the following skill books:

- March Size Increase
- March Speed Increase
- Whichever of Ranged Troop HP _OR_ Ranged Troop Defense is NOT on the primary general

### Light Spenders:

The primary difference between Light Spenders and Free Players
is that a Light Spender may be able to get an assistant that also has
a covenant, and to develop enough generals that the covenant is at least
partly active.  Your pairs will be stronger, typically have larger march
sizes, and thus you should consider different skill books.

* You should include the Siege Machines Range Increase book instead of the
  March Speed Increase book.  You should be able to use research to develop
  your March Speed to acceptable levels instead.
* You should look at the [buffs] on your pair.  They probably have a
  secondary troop type, frequently Siege Machines.  Consider including the Attack book for this type in place of the Ranged Defense book.
* If either the primary or secondary general has a March Size increase as
  part of their main built in skill book, and yet does not conflict with the march size increase book, include that book on that general.  Adjust book placement accordingly.


### Medium Spenders:

As noted in the [Overview], you *really* need to find a pair where both primary and assistant have covenants, and where you can develop the generals enough to activate those convenants.

Your books will be much the same as the Light Spender's.  The primary difference is that it is time to consider specializing somewhat futher. You
do *not* need to avoid generals with adjectives and adverbs the way the light spender does.  However, you will need to consider a separate pair for
Attacking and Reinforcing.

Also, if you decide to go after the Pans every other week, consider a PvM
primary general who is compatible with one of your main PvP generals.  Use the PvM general as a Monster Primary and your PvP general as its assistant. Give the PvM general Ranged Monster books.
