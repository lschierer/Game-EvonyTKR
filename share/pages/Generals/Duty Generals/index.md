<aside class="note">
In the [Overview], I explain my thinking. This is a fairly long article, but
contains a lot of useful background information if you want to understand how
I arrived at these conclusions. If you just want to be told what to do, you
can skip it and dive right in here.

## In General (no pun intended)

As you upgrade your various buildings, many of them allow you to appoint duty
officers. This is highly advantageous. In rough terms, there is either

1. a general who specializes in being a duty officer for this building available in the tavern
1. a premium general who specializes in being a duty officer for this building available to win during events
1. a premium general who specializes in being a duty officer for this building available only if you pay thousands of dollars
1. no general at all who specializes in being a duty officer for this building;

- Where the premium generals exist, the tavern option also generally exists.
  - The premium general is almost always worth getting even if you cannot ascend the general.
  - You _may_ be able to offset the difference by ascending the tavern general,
    but I have not fully explored an unbalanced comparison of that type.
  - Hold off on using any rune stones or Blood of Ares until you are sure you
    are going to stick with a given duty general.
- Duty generals do _**NOT**_ benefit from skill books, unless you spend to get the specialized officer skill books.
- Duty generals _**DO**_ benefit from armor, but **ONLY** at the precise moment
  when appointed as a duty officer. Once appointed, the armor can be removed.
  This is very important, as it means you can take the set of armor you craft
  for your wall general and cycle it through all your duty generals, saving a
  TON of time and money.
- As an exception to the above point, there is specialized officer gear specific to each officer position.  Officers
  benefit from wearing this gear all the time.
- Some buildings require an officer full time. Others do not.

## Buildings with Dedicated Generals

### Archer Tower

- You can start using a duty general at Archer Tower level 11
- A duty general is necessary whenever you might be attacked.

### Hospital

- You can start using a duty general at hospital level 15
- A duty officer is necessary whenever you are initiating the healing of
  troops. The officer need not stay assigned for the full duration.

:::tip
Some strong players actively dislike having a hospital duty officer, they
prefer to rely on Source of Life rather than on Hospital Capacity and Healing
Speed. There are strong arguments both ways.

### Keep

- You can start using a duty general at keep level 16
- Depends on the [buffs][] of the officer. Officers that offer troop buffs must be
  present when those troops are used. Construction buffs are only used when
  construction is initiated. You need not keep the general assigned for the
  duration of the construction.

### Trap Factory

- You can start using a duty general at trap factory level 19
- Should be continuously assigned.
- This is the one place I am unsure if the premium general is worth getting.
  Siege damage is inevitable, and the high cost of repairs is one of the
  biggest barriers to using siege effectively in the game. A general that
  reduces those costs may be worth more than the difference in
  [buffs][]/[debuffs][] that we see here.

### Academy

- You can start using a duty general at academy level 20
- Depends on the [buffs][] of the officer. Officers that offer troop buffs must be
  present when those troops are used. Research buffs are only used when
  research is initiated. You need not keep the general assigned for the
  duration of the research.

### Archer Camp

- You can start using a duty general at archer camp level 21
- Should be continuously assigned.

### Barracks

- You can start using a duty general at barracks level 25
- Should be continuously assigned.

### Workshop

- You can start using a duty general at workshop level 29
- Should be continuously assigned.

### Stables

- You can begin using a duty general at stables level 33
- Should be continuously assigned.

### Rally Spot

- You can begin using a duty general at rally spot level 35
- Should be continuously assigned.
