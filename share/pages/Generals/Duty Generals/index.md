:::note
In the [Overview][], I explain my thinking. This is a fairly long article, but
contains a lot of useful background information if you want to understand how I
arrived at these conclusions. If you just want to be told what to do, you can
skip it and dive right in here.

## In General (no pun intended)

As you upgrade your various buildings, many of them allow you to appoint duty
officers. This is highly advantageous. In rough terms, there is either

1. a general who specializes in being a duty officer for this building available in the tavern
1. a premium general who specializes in being a duty officer for this building available to win during events
1. a premium general who specializes in being a duty officer for this building available only if you pay thousands of dollars
1. no general at all who specializes in being a duty officer for this building;

- Where the premium generals exist, the tavern option also generally exists.
  - The premium general is almost always worth getting even if you cannot ascend the general.
  - You _may_ be able to offset the difference by ascending the tavern general,
    but I have not fully explored an unbalanced comparison of that type.
  - Hold off on using any rune stones or Blood of Ares until you are sure you
    are going to stick with a given duty general.
- Duty generals do _**NOT**_ benefit from skill books.
- Duty generals _**DO**_ benefit from armor, but **ONLY** at the precise moment
  when appointed as a duty officer. Once appointed, the armor can be removed.
  This is very important, as it means you can take the set of armor you craft
  for your wall general and cycle it through all your duty generals, saving a
  TON of time and money.
- Some buildings require an officer full time. Others do not.

## Buildings with Dedicated Generals

### Archer Tower

- You can start using a duty general at Archer Tower level 11
- A duty general is necessary whenever you might be attacked.
- Maurice of Nassau
  - Premium General
    - occasionally available to win for free from events.
    - typically requires very high spending in the King's Party Bonus event
  - Strongest Buffs (at 3-Orange Specialties Level):
    - In-City Ranged Attack Increase (when Archer Tower Officer): +20%
    - In-City Siege Attack Increase (when Archer Tower Officer): +20%
    - Reduce Enemy Ranged Attack (when Archer Tower Officer): +15%
    - Archer Tower Attack Increase (when Archer Tower Officer): +54%
- Ban Chao
  - Tavern General
  - Strongest Buffs (at 3-Orange Specialties Level):
    - In-City Ranged Attack Increase (when Archer Tower Officer): +20%
    - Reduce Enemy Mounted Attack (when Archer Tower Officer): +20%
    - Archer Tower Attack Increase (when Archer Tower Officer): +54%

### Hospital

- You can start using a duty general at hospital level 15
- A duty officer is necessary whenever you are initiating the healing of
  troops. The officer need not stay assigned for the full duration.
- Skanderbeg
  - Tavern General
  - Strongest Buffs (at 3-Orange Specialties Level):
    - Hospital Capacity Increase (when Hospital Officer): +25%
    - Healing Speed Increase (when Hospital Officer): +12%

:::tip
Some strong players actively dislike having a hospital duty officer, they
prefer to rely on Source of Life rather than on Hospital Capacity and Healing
Speed. There are strong arguments both ways.

### Keep

- You can start using a duty general at keep level 16
- Depends on the [buffs][] of the officer. Officers that offer troop buffs must be
  present when those troops are used. Construction buffs are only used when
  construction is initiated. You need not keep the general assigned for the
  duration of the construction.
- Ashoka
  - Premium General
    - occasionally available to win for free from events.
    - typically requires very high spending in the King's Party Bonus event
      Strongest Buffs (at 3-Orange Specialties Level):
  - Ranged Attack Increase (when Keep Officer): +20%
  - Reduce Enemy Ground HP (when Keep Officer): +15%
  - Construction Speed Increase (when Keep Officer): +6%
- Zhuge Liang or Menshikov (these generals are equivalent)
  - both Tavern Generals
  - Strongest Buffs (at 3-Orange Specialties Level):
    - Construction Speed Increase (when Keep Officer): +26%

### Trap Factory

- You can start using a duty general at trap factory level 19
- Should be continuously assigned.
- This is the one place I am unsure if the premium general is worth getting.
  Siege damage is inevitable, and the high cost of repairs is one of the
  biggest barriers to using siege effectively in the game. A general that
  reduces those costs may be worth more than the difference in
  [buffs][]/[debuffs][] that we see here.
- Otto the Great
  - Premium General
    - I have not seen him in an event that you do not have to pay to win
    - typically requires very high spending in the King's Party Bonus event
  - Strongest Buffs (at 3-Orange Specialties Level):
    - In-City Siege Attack Increase (when Trap Factory Officer): +36%
    - Reduce Enemy Ranged Attack (when Trap Factory Officer): +15%
    - Trap Building Speed Increase (when Trap Factory Officer): +24%
- Askia Muhammad I
  - Tavern General
  - Strongest Buffs (at 3-Orange Specialties Level):
    - In-City Siege Attack Increase (when Trap Factory Officer): +25%
    - Reduce Siege Repair Costs (when Trap Factory Officer): +15%
    - Trap Building Speed Increase (when Trap Factory Officer): +24%
    - Damaged Siege Capacity Increase (when Trap Factory Officer): +12%

### Academy

- You can start using a duty general at academy level 20
- Depends on the [buffs][] of the officer. Officers that offer troop buffs must be
  present when those troops are used. Research buffs are only used when
  research is initiated. You need not keep the general assigned for the
  duration of the research.
- Hammurabi
  - Premium General
    - I have not seen him in an event that you do not have to pay to win
    - typically requires very high spending in the King's Party Bonus event
  - Strongest Buffs (at 3-Orange Specialties Level):
    - Research Speed Increase (when Academy Officer): +16%
    - Ranged Defense Increase (when Academy Officer): +20%
    - Siege Defense Increase (when Academy Officer): +20%
- Eulji Mundeok
  - This is almost a second exception. If you do get Hammurabi, I recommend
    still developing Mundeok's third specialty (and only this one specialty) to
    the Orange or even Gold level as a peace time duty officer. As you advance
    in the game, research starts to become prohibitively expensive in terms of
    both time and gold. While Mundeok only helps with the time, that is not
    something to discount.
  - Tavern General
  - Strongest Buffs (at 3-Orange Specialties Level):
    - Research Speed Increase (when Academy Officer): +26%
