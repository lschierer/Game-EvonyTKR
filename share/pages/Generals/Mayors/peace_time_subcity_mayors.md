Periodically someone asks about Catherine II, or another of the peace time
subcity mayors. To answer this question, we need to compare the two following
generals.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Catherine II">
    ![Catherine II](/assets/generals/Catherine_II.jpg) This instance of
    Catherine II has been only partially cultivated. * Leadership: +201 *
    Attack: +119 * Defense: +143 * Politics: +214
  </Card>
  <Card title="Harald">
    ![Harald](/assets/generals/Harald.jpg) This instance of Harald has
    been extensively cultivated. * Leadership: +500 * Attack: +258 * Defense:
    +284 * Politics: +500
  </Card>

Both mayors have been put on the same subcity in turn. Mayor number 1,
Catherine, results in an average training speed of +329.79% while mayor number
2, Harald, results in an average speed of +441.2%. Thus, despite Catherine's
special skill, Domination, giving her a training speed boost of 35% to Harald's
25% Level 4 Training Speed skill book, he is able to train troops faster.

If I were willing to give Catherine the extra two stars, and to cultivate her
to an equal extent, I have no doubt that she would outperform Harald. The
question is, given how many gems are involved in cultivating mayors up to that
level, can you afford to do so to two sets of them?

This is one of those places in Evony where you need to make a decision on your
spending levels. If you want to have peace time subcity mayors, be prepared to
invest significant amounts of gems, rune stones, and medals in them. If you
are not willing to do so, your more fully developed war time generals will
probably provide better training, construction, and gold bonuses than a poorly
developed set of peace time generals.
