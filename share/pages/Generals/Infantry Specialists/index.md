<aside class="note">
In the [Overview], I explain my thinking. This is a fairly long article, but
contains a lot of useful background information if you want to understand how
I arrived at these conclusions. If you just want to be told what to do, you
can skip it and dive right in here.

### For Free to Play Players:

This will be the fourth general you look at. It is lower priority than your
[Mounted] General, [Ranged] General, and [Wall] General.

Spread the following 5 skill books between your two generals:

- Ground Troop Attack
- Ground Troop Speed
- Ground Troop Defense
- March Size
- March Speed

As your sixth skill book, there's a fair amount of debate. Pick either
* Ground (Movement) Speed
* Siege Range Bonus

#### Specific General Notes

- Some of the ground generals with the highest attack [buffs] have *very* low HP and defense [buffs].
  Survivability is absolutely crucial in ground troops, and so the balance between the attack statistic and the other two
  will be different for this type.  Your milage may vary.
- Note that a number of desirable choices conflict with one or more of the above skill books.  If that happens, fill in with ranged skill books.
- Note that some generals have march size buffs in their built in skill book, and yet do *not* conflict with the march size book.  If you have one of
  these, give that one the March Size book.

### For light spenders

Stay away from the temptation to invest in Elise. While until Aurelian, she
was theoretically the best ground general out there, that is only true if you can give her a dragon. You are likely to only have 2 dragons for a LONG time - one for
ranged, and one for mounted. Elise stinks without a dragon. While Ludwig is
not quite as attractive as Elise, he suffers from the same fatal flaw, and so
should be avoided for the same reason.  At the time of writing, both Elise and Ludwig are hopelessly outclassed even with dragons by generals with [covenants] anyway.

[Ranged]: ./ranged
