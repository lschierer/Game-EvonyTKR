# Why Another Evony Tips Site

## Tips for Budget Gamers

There are lots of sites out there with tips on playing Evony. Why am I creating yet another? I find that the advice I am giving younger and/or less knowledgable players differs from what I find on any single site out there. This is largely because so many of the sites are targeted on people who spend far more on the game than I do. While they have tons of very valuable info, figuring out the right course for the player with a smaller budget can be a real challenge. This site is based on my experiences playing on a more limited budget.

Much of the information here comes from other authors' work on other sites. In particular, I am heavily relying on the work of:

- [Evony Answers](https://www.evonyanswers.com/)
- [Derrick Defies](https://www.youtube.com/@DerrickDefies)
- [https://evonyguidewiki.com/](https://evonyguidewiki.com/)
- [Theria Games](https://theriagames.com/evony-wiki/)
- [One Chilled Gamer](https://onechilledgamer.com/)
- [Evony The King's Return Guides](https://www.evonytkrguide.com/)
