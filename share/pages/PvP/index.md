The pages in this section will attempt to provide what advice I can about
participating in [SvS][] on a budget. Much of this advice is under-tested, or
even un-tested, as I am still just starting my own SvS journey in many ways. If
you allow a mixed metaphor, Take anything you find here with a grain of
salt, because your mileage may vary.
