First off there are two types of participation, [minimal][], and active player
versus player (PvP). This article is looking at the latter.

[minimal]: ../minimal

For now be aware that everything here is somewhat speculative - I have just started
as an active participant myself in SvS. I am collecting here the knowledge of those
who are more experienced to augment my own very minimal time in role.

### Minimums

- You should have at least a +1000% buff for attack in your main troop type.
- You should have at least a +500% buff for attack in all other troop types.
- You should have at least a +%X00% buff for defence and HP in all troop types.[^fixme]

Measure this by attacking an empty keep and looking at the report.

### Behavior

Do not [splat][]. This will just annoy the other players on your server. While
it might generate lots of points, it will not help your server win.

[^fixme]: I need to get the right value for this.
