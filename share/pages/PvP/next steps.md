The following is based on the recommendations of bigger players, I have not tested this myself yet.

## Troops

### t1s

- 80,000,000 mounted
- 1,000,000 ground
- 1,000,000 ranged
- 1,000,000 siege

Your mounted troops should survive well against both a ground march and a
ranged march. It should not do _badly_ against a mounted march. A siege
attack will bypass your t1s no matter the type.

Over build the mounted type so that you can withstand several hits.

### t2s

- 1,000,000 mounted
- 1,000,000 ground
- 200,000 ranged
- 200,000 siege

Try to increase that mounted count to 20,000,000 over time. Basically this is your buffer in case someone gets through your t1s.

### t3 through t9 (each)

#### before reaching keep size 30

- 50,000 mounted
- 50,000 ground
- 50,000 ranged
- 50,000 siege

#### before reaching keep size 33

- 100,000 mounted
- 100,000 ground
- 100,000 ranged
- 100,000 siege

#### before reaching keep size 35

- 200,000 mounted
- 200,000 ground
- 200,000 ranged
- 200,000 siege

### t10s

- 900,000 mounted, or your maximum march size, which ever is _smaller_
- follow the guidance for t9s for ground
- follow the guidance for t9s for ranged
- follow the guidance for t9s for siege

### t11s

#### before keep size 33

- 2,000,000 mounted, or your maximum march size, whichever is _smaller_
- follow the guidance for t9s for ground
- follow the guidance for t9s for ranged
- follow the guidance for t9s for siege

#### after keep size 33 and ghosting

- If you are, continue to follow the guidance above for keeps smaller than size 33.
  - you will be severely limited in what you can hunt
  - you may be limited in the size of your attack march
  - you may have to consider using mounted as your primary attack troop type even for PvP.
- slowly and carefully build more siege while remaining ghostable. Some day you will want 4,000,000 t11 siege.

#### after keep size 33, but not ghosting

- 2,000,000 siege
- 1,000,000 ground
- 1,000,000 mounted
- 1,000,000 ranged _over and above what you need to attack with_
- increase your t11 sieged to 4,000,000 over time
- You may need to start bubbling more until you reach a stable point, test your defenses in battlefield regularly.

### t12s

#### before keep size 33

- 2,000,000 mounted, or your maximum march size, whichever is _smaller_
- follow the guidance for t9s for ground
- follow the guidance for t9s for ranged
- follow the guidance for t9s for siege

#### after keep size 33, and ghosting

- 2,000,000 mounted, or your maximum march size, whichever is _smaller_
- 500,000 ground
- 3,000,000 ranged _over and above what you need to attack with_
- 1,000,000 siege
- you may be ghosting only your t11s and above.

#### after keep size 33, but not ghosting

- 2,000,000 mounted, or your maximum march size, whichever is _smaller_
- 1,000,000 ground
- 5,000,000 ranged _over and above what you need to attack with_
- 1,500,000 siege
- increase your t12 siege slowly over time to 2,000,000, try to keep a steady ratio between t11s and t12s.

### t13s

#### ghosting

- 1,000,000 mounted
- 1,000,000 ground
- 1,000,000 ranged
- 1,000,000 siege
- increase your _mounted_ while remaining ghostable, to 2,000,000
- you will be ghosting only your t11s and above.

#### not ghosting

- 2,000,000 mounted
- 1,000,000 ground
- 1,000,000 ranged _over and above what you need to attack with_
- 1,000,000 siege

## equipment refines

These figures assume you ghost everything above t11. If you are not ghosting
your siege, you _will_ have higher repair bills. But I suspect you can kill
more of an attack off as well. You will want to adjust _ONLY THE ATTACK_
refines if that is the case. For siege only the attack statistic matters, use
other troop types to keep your siege alive. If you are being attacked _by_
siege, then your only two options are to dodge the attack (port away) or to
have more siege and more range than your attacker. Refer back to the [T1 Defense] for more on this.

### for your wall general

You want to change out the attack lines for different troop types depending on what you see in your reports.

- 950+ mounted attack
  - x4 wall general's ax
  - x3 at least 3 general's ring
- 450+ ground attack
  - use one line on your wall general's ring for this.
- 650+ mounted defense
  - 2x on his boots
  - 2x on his armor
  - you can do 4x on one piece here and 4x on the other piece in the next section.
- 1450+ ground defense
  - 2x on his boots
  - 2x on his armor
  - you can do 4x on one piece here and 4x on the other piece in the previous section.
  - You may choose to devote anywhere between six and eight lines (four for the boots, four for the armor) to mounted instead of four and four.
- 1700+ mounted HP
  - 2x on his helmet
  - 2x on his leg armor
  - you can do 4x on one piece here and 4x on the other piece in the previous section.
- 2400+ ground HP
  - 2x on his helmet
  - 2x on his leg armor
  - you can do 4x on one piece here and 4x on the other piece in the previous section.
  - You may choose to devote anywhere between six and eight lines (four for the boots, four for the armor) to mounted instead of four and four.

### for your subcities

Focus on training speed refines. Your subcity troops will almost always be few
in number, low in tier, and very poorly, if at all, layered. Thus they will
die off fast. The key is that you only need one per subcity so that the
mayor's debuff is effective. Troop training speed is essential to ensuring
that each mayor has troops to keep him/her available to you.
