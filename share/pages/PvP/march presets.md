title: March Presets

## Initial setup

When creating a PvP march preset, you first create your layers. The size of your layers will depend on the size of your march. Always set up a PvP march with the same march size buff active that you will use during either SvS or battle field. Changing the size of your march buff will cause the game to do very bad things to your layers. For the same reason, a march preset will be specific to a single pair of generals. This is because as you develop your generals, each pair of generals will have a unique march size.

- If your march size is greater than or equal to three million, use a layer size of 1000 troops.
- If your march size is between two and three million, use a layer size of 500 troops.
- If your march size is between one and two million, use a layer size of 100 troops.
- If your march size is less than one million, use a layer size of 50 troops.

Next we look at the details for marches that are centered around a single troop type.
