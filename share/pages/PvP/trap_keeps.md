At some point, as an alliance if not as an individual, you will want to build what is known as a "trap keep." This is not an account that you will use for regular play, rather it is dedicated to SvS play, and in particular is configured to be attacked by the enemy.

The goal of this account is that when (not if) it is attacked, you want to cost the enemy more in points than they gain in killing your troops. Thus you want to be a tempting target, but not actually give up much. This is why you will not be getting much normal use from this account - the need to keep the points you give up small precludes having _anything_ extra in this account.

It was with the goal of setting up a trap keep based on t1 mounted that Redwood, who I am continuing to credit as co-author, was aiming for when he wrote the king's mails that formed the initial basis of this, and the [t1 defense], article. You will want to have read that article first.

For this purpose, you will want to go with Dewey and Queen Boudica as your wall generals. I see no point in spending a lot on premium generals for what is essentially a secondary account.

## Refines

### Attack Refines

- 4 mounted attack refines on your ax
- 3 mounted attack refines on your ring
- 1 ground attack refine on your ring
- each mounted attack refine should have a value of 950 or better
- the ground attack refine should have a value of 450 or better

### Health refines

HP and Defense are both essentially about survival. This can be summarized as either "health" or "toughness."

### Refine your helmet and leg armor looking for HP.

- Look for Mounted HP values in excess of 1700.
- Look for Ground HP values in excess of 2400.
- Flat refines on 4 of the 8 possible values for mounted HP
- Flat refines on the other 4 for ground HP

### Refine your chest armor and boots looking for defense.

- Look for Mounted Defense values in excess of 650.
- Look for Ground Defense values in excess of 1450.
- Flat refines on 4 of the 8 possible values for mounted defense
- Flat refines on 4 of the 8 possible values for ground defense
