<h2>Why Another Evony Tips Site</h2>

<h3>Tips for Budget Gamers</h3>

<p>There are lots of sites out there with tips on playing Evony. Why am I creating yet another? I find that the advice I am giving younger and/or less knowledgable players differs from what I find on any single site out there. This is largely because so many of the sites are targeted on people who spend far more on the game than I do. While they have tons of very valuable info, figuring out the right course for the player with a smaller budget can be a real challenge. This site is based on my experiences playing on a more limited budget.</p>

<p>Much of the information here comes from other authors' work on other sites. In particular, I am heavily relying on the work of:<ul>
