  - term: SkillBook
    definition: >-
      There are two types of SkillBooks: Built-in books and other SkillBooks.
      Both are the same in that they are attached to a 'General' and provide
      'Buffs' and/or 'Debuffs' to your game play.  These may be 'unconditional'
      in that they affect your game play all the time for as long as you
      own the 'General' or they may be 'conditional' in that they only configs:
      take effect when you use the 'General' in the specified way. configs:
      'Other' skill books are further subdivided into 'Military,' 'Development,'
      'Subordinate City,' 'Debuff', and 'Officer' Books.  These differ only
      in how you can obtain them, and in which situations you might use them.

  - term: Subordinate City
    definition: >-
      In addition to your primary keep, which is also called your 'city,' the game allows you to attach
      one or more additional keeps to your account.  One is automatic, and does not show on the map.
      Additional ones come with increases in rank and/or VIP level, and are on the map.  These additional ones can be attacked, and taken from you.
      All subordinate cities behave the same way while you own them (except that only some can be directly attacked). Each provides
      certain 'Buffs' based on the 'Culture' of that city (NOT your culture), and allows you to attach a 'General' to the city as 'Mayor'.
      This 'Mayor' will provide additional benefits, primarily in the form of 'Debuffs.'

    definition: >-
      In certain use cases, you can attach two Generals for use instead of just one.  The secondary is the second one attached, and can only *be*
      attached if the first one is at least level 23, with at least 3 stars.  This second general is only partly utilized.  You get the benefit
      from its 'SkillBooks', 'Specialties', and 'Covenant', but not from its 'Basic Attributes', 'Gear', 'Dragon'/'Spiritual Beast', or 'Ascending Attributes.'
  - term: Spiritual Beast
    definition: >-
      Each 'General' has a slots that can be filled to provide additional 'Buffs' and 'Debuffs.' One of these is for the 'Dragon' or Spiritual Beast.
      A 'Dragon' and Spiritual Beast are mutually exclusive, and fill the same role in the game, but differ in quality.  A Spiritual Beast is a more
      limited way in which to provide extra 'Buffs' and/or 'Debuffs' to your 'General'.  Spiritual Beasts are usually more easily obtained than
      'Dragons', and more frequently provide 'Debuffs' to the 'General' to whom they are attached.  However, the Spiritual Beast provides a smaller
      total number of Buffs/Debuffs, and there is less potential room for growth in the value of these Buffs/Debuffs.

  - term: Specialty
    definition: >-
      Each 'General' has either three or four slots for 'Specialties.'  In Gold and Red Historical Generals with slots for four specialties, the
      fourth specialty is different in certain ways. 1) It is always unique to that 'General.' 2) It can only be activated once the first three
      are fully developed to 'Gold' level.  3) When the first three *are* developed to 'Gold' level, the 'Green' level of this fourth specialty
      is automatically activated.  Specialties have levels 'Green', 'Blue', 'Purple', 'Orange', and 'Gold' levels, in that order, with each
      requiring a greater number of the corresponding 'Rune Stone' resource to activate.  Obtaining these Rune Stones is one of the major limitations
      in developing a 'General.'  On Generals with four specialties, a fifth "flex specialty" may be attached once the fourth is at least partly developed.
