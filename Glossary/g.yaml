  - term: General
    definition: >-
      The game provides characters called 'Generals' that perform a number of roles.  The common theme to these roles is that the Generals provide
      you with 'Buffs' and 'Debuffs' which you can activate either by owning the General or by using the General. Generals provide these 'Buffs'
      and 'Debuffs' by way of 'Basic Attributes', 'SkillBooks', 'Ascending Attributes', 'Specialties', 'Covenants', any 'Gear' assigned to that
      General, and any 'Dragon' or 'Spiritual Beast' assigned.
