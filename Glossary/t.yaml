    definition: >-
      In any fight, there is a probability that some troops will be killed, and a second probability that some will desert.
      The Death to Wounded rate 'rescues' a percentage of these 'killed' and 'deserting' troops, causing them to instead
      become wounded and go to your hospital. This is only effective if your hospital is not full. Further, it is unclear
      that it plays any role at all in battlefield, where no troops can be killed or desert.
