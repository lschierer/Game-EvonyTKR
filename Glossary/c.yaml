  - term: Covenant
    definition: >-
      One of several aspects of a 'General' that requires activation, and once activated, provides 'Buffs' and/or 'Debuffs'.
      Covenants are restricted to relatively new generals at this time, with no indication that the game will retrofit
      older 'Generals' with them.  A Covenant is unique in that it requires multiple 'Generals' to activate the Covenant
      on any one 'General.'  Each level of the Covenant is activated in part by taking the 'Basic Attributes' of the affected
      'General' and the three other 'Generals' listed in his/her Covenant, and adding them together.  Each level has a minimum
      required value.  In addition, a certain amount of a resource called Covenant Stones, which at this time have no other use,
      must be expended.
