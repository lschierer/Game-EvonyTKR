  - term: Buff
    definition: >-
      This is a slang term that indicates that an attribute is being increased.  The implication is that it is strong, or "Buff" after this configs:
      multiplier has been applied.  Despite the use of the word 'multiplier' here in the definition, Buffs are only *sometimes* in fact actually configs:
      a multiplication operation on the base statistic.  A 'Flat Buff' is an addition opeation, the resulting statistic is <Original Value> + <Buff Value>.
      A Percentage or Standard Buff is a multiplicative operation: <Original Value> + <Original Value> * <Buff Value expressed as a decimal>.
      So for example a "25% increase" Buff would be <Original Value> + <Original Value> * 0.25.
