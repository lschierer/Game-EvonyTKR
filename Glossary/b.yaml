      You get 4 groups of blazons, one for each troop type, available by clicking on the buildings that train troops.
      Each group has six individual blazons, and three presets for using them.
        troop type offers two sets of blazons. You get additional 'buffs' if you fill the preset in use with blazons that
        all come from the same set. Each Blazon can be upgraded, by combining other blazons into it. This results in additional, entirely
        random buffs being added.  This lottery process is one of the more fustrating in the Game. Each can also be Cultivated, enhancing
        the buffs added through the lottery.

  - term: Buff
    definition: >-
      This is a slang term that indicates that an attribute is being increased.  The implication is that it is strong, or "Buff" after this
      multiplier has been applied.  Despite the use of the word 'multiplier' here in the definition, Buffs are only *sometimes* in fact actually
      a multiplication operation on the base statistic.  A 'Flat Buff' is an addition opeation, the resulting statistic is <Original Value> + <Buff Value>.
      A Percentage or Standard Buff is a multiplicative operation: <Original Value> + <Original Value> * <Buff Value expressed as a decimal>.
      So for example a "25% increase" Buff would be <Original Value> + <Original Value> * 0.25.
