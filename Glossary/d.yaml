  - term: Debuff
    definition: >-
      A Debuff is really the same as a 'Buff' except that it decreases, rather than increases, the affected statistic/attribute.
      Debuffs are also distinct in that you cannot reduce an enemy's attributes by more than half of the value they started at before
      any Debuffs were applied.

  - term: Defense
    definition: >-
      One of the 'Basic Attribute' which affects the related troops' defense statistic across all activation conditions, but only when the 'General'
      is being used as a 'Primary General.'  A common misconception is that this applies only when someone else attacks you. The reality is that
      there is an aspect of defense used all the time.  That is because this basic attribute can be thought of as a debuff against an opponent's
      attack attribute, whether they are initiating the attack, or counter attacking.

  - term: Dragon
    definition: >-
      Each 'General' has a slots that can be filled to provide additional 'Buffs' and 'Debuffs.' One of these is for the Dragon or 'Spiritual Beast.'
      A Dragon and 'Spiritual Beast' are mutually exclusive, and fill the same role in the game, but differ in quality.  A Dragon offers a wider
      variety of 'Buffs' and 'Debuffs', in that the Dragon can be refined, with four slots for Buffs that the user selects from the refining attributes.
      Additionally, the Dragon offers greater room for growth in the value of its built-in 'Buffs' (or 'Debuffs'), in that the Dragon itself can be
      leveled more extensively, and some of these Buffs/Debuffs are leveled independantly as 'Talents.'
