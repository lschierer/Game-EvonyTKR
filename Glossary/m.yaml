    definition: >-
      A General placed in in charge of a 'Subordinate City.'  This General will, depending on its 'Basic Attributes,'
      activate 'Buffs' from simply owning the city.  It will also lead any troops in the City, and if and only if
      a General is present, these troops can (optionally, depending on toggles set), assist either your main keep, or other
      Subordinate Cities, in their defense if attacked.  If a General is present, Subordinate City troops may also accompany
      you on solo attacks.
